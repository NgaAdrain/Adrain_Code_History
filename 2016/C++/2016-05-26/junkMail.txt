Dear #F#,
Am in a hurry writing you this note, I just wanted to seek your help on something very important, you are the only person I could reach at this point, and I hope you come to my aid. Because something very terrible is happening to me now, I need a favor from you now; I had a trip here in the UK on a mission.

Unfortunately for me all my money got stolen on my way to the hotel where I lodged along with my bag where my passport was, and since then I have been without any money I am even owing the hotel here. So please I need you to lend me about 1650 Pounds so I can make arrangements and return back. I have spoken to the embassy here but they are not responding to the matter effectively, I will return the money back to you as soon as I get home, I am so confused right now.
#N#, I will be waiting to hear from you.
 
Regards
Jun
